157,What have you learned about love?,2022-01-09,"Im not sure this answers the questionbut something Ive learned and seen in other relationships is dont lose yourself for the other person. Dont change your hobbies, dreams, interests if they dont match up. Its okay to like different things. I think love is when two individual people come together and learn from each other and share experiences together while knowing you both are independent but are making the choice to come together and share life together. An example, Im not a runner so if I ever dated a runner, Im not going to change myself and start running to make the other feel better. Ill continue doing what I enjoy (yoga) and support them in their hobby/passion from the sideline. We can still support and lift each other up without changing who we are.",5,Very thought provoking.
