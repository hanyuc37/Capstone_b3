When the conversation wasnt about my day or school or work, I would learn something new from my dad about nature, art, God, myself, or a random diy house project. He taught me that I can do almost anything if Im willing to be creative and to take action. Because my parents are a package deal I must include my mom. She taught me that Im never alone, that I am worthy of love, and that there is always something you can offer to another. She taught me to be like butter, dont let things stick to you can let them slide right off of you. Shes also taught me how to live a life like Jesus by being like him and by loving so gracefully.

He had high expectations, but his lessons forced me to change as a student - I became more accountable, took better notes, asked questions.
